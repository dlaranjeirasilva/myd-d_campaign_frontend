It allows you to create and manage your character and keep track of its inventory, spells, abilities and more useful information. Now you won't have a problem with your character profile passing through common accidents like getting lost, torn, worn-out or maybe fall into the jaws of the most unbeatable creature of all: your dog. üê∂</p>
